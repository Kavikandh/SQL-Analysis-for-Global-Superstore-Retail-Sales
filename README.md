# Global Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

End-to-End Business Intelligence project analyzing global retail sales performance, profitability, return impact, and year-over-year growth trends using SQL and Power BI.

## Business Problem
Retail leadership needs visibility into:
- Revenue trends across years
- Profitability by segment and category
- Impact of product returns
- Regional performance differences

This project transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

## 🔍 Key Business Insights

- Revenue increased from $2.26M in 2011 to $4.30M in 2014, demonstrating strong and consistent year-over-year growth.

- The Consumer segment contributes the largest share of total revenue, with stable profit margins (~11–12%) across all segments.

- Technology is the most profitable category (13.99% margin), while Furniture generates high revenue but significantly lower margin (6.94%), indicating cost or discount inefficiencies.

- APAC is the top revenue-generating market ($3.59M), showing strong global diversification across EU and US regions as well.

- Profitability declines sharply as discount levels increase. Orders with discounts above 20% frequently generate negative average profit, highlighting pricing risks.

- Several high-value products (e.g., large equipment and furniture items) contribute to cumulative losses, suggesting the need for pricing and cost re-evaluation.

- Regional analysis shows profit imbalance — some regions generate high revenue but relatively low profit, indicating operational optimization opportunities.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Implement stricter discount control policies
- Re-evaluate pricing strategy for low-margin categories
- Optimize cost structure in underperforming regions
- Monitor high-return product categories more closely
